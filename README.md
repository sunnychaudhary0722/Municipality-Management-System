In this project, we aim to present our understanding of Database Management System by implementing it to create a database system for municipality. The database will store all the details of the citizens living under the municipality area, projects controlled by the municipality, employees working at the municipality office and other such details. Many government offices have not been digitalized despite being in the twenty first century. This model is a proof of concept for implementing a robust system even in the remote parts of the country. Our project is the full-fledged website implementation of Municipality Management System which digitalizes the municipality system and ensures reliable, faster and efficient municipality services to the concerned users.
