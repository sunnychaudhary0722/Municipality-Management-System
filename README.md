In this project, we aim to demonstrate our understanding of Database Management Systems by developing a comprehensive database for a municipality. This system will capture essential data such as information about citizens residing in the municipality, ongoing and completed projects managed by the municipality, employees working in municipal offices, and other relevant records. Despite advancements in technology, many government offices remain undigitized, particularly in rural areas. Our project serves as a proof of concept, showcasing how a well-structured, reliable, and efficient digital system can be implemented even in remote regions. This web-based Municipality Management System streamlines municipal operations, offering faster and more reliable services to users while promoting a more organized and modernized public service infrastructure.
